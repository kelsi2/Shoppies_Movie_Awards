# Shoppies Movie Awards

<b>[This website is live on Netlify!](https://shoppies-movie-awards.netlify.app/)</b>

Built for the 2021 Summer internship at Shopify, this app allows users to search
for and nominate 5 of their favorite movies. The app searches
[OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) for movies and manages nominations so
Shopify can host its own movie awards, the Shoppies!
